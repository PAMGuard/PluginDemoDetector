# PluginDemoDetector
This is a really simple detector, which was written for a PAMGuard workshop held back right at the start of the project, in around 2007. 

It's main purpose is to show developers how to make processing modules for 
PAMGuard and how either to set them up as a plug-in, which can be added to an existing PAMGuard installation, or to build them into PAMGuard. 

There are 11 separate Java files which make up the plugin, though some of these are trivially small, mostly just wrapping one of the standard 
PAMGuard classes.
